# Wallets

Self-custody of your bitcoin is extremely important for both yourself and the ecosystem as a whole.
Since Bitcoin's inception there have been many exchanges that were either [hacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox)
or [committed fraud with customer funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX) or [became insolvent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius_Network)
and effectively stole their users' funds.

However, it's just as important to understand what you're doing. Great power, great responsibility, etc.
If you don't do it right you can lose access to your funds.

# Hot wallets

A hot wallet is software installed and used on an internet connected device. If it can be remotely accessed
it can be stolen (even intelligence agencies can't secure their own networks).

Hot wallets are useful for things like daily spending. You don't want to store large amounts in a hot wallet
but it's ok to store a week's worth of spending money for example.

# Cold wallets

A cold wallet is software running on dedicated hardware (preferably a device specifically designed for bitcoin, but in a pinch could
be an old device like a laptop. DO NOT USE an old laptop or raspberry pi if you can avoid it.)

# Options

When choosing a wallet be sure to compare them yourself to see what makes sense for you.
There are at least 2 strict rules:
- it MUST be open source
- it ONLY supports bitcoin; if the developers spread their attention across many "cryptocurrencies" they are likely to introduce security vulnerabilities
