# Concepts

For many people the learning curve is steep and all the terms can be foreign.
This note should serve as a basic introduction to the most fundamental concepts
of bitcoin as a general user. It is not meant to be a deep technical document but
rather a "getting started" page.

After reading this page you should know enough to get around the bitcoin ecosystem
for the majority of today's current use cases. Bitcoin is still evolving and the number
and nature of use cases changes quickly. Having said that, this document will mostly
contain the concepts and features that have become relatively mature and stable.

# Nodes

The bitcoin network is made of ordinary computers each storing a copy of the bitcoin
blockchain. These "nodes" are responsible for enforcing the rules and are therefore
the most important component of the system. Each node can have a separate set of
rules they enforce and the intersection of all the rules on all the nodes defines
what transactions are valid.

One of the design considerations for bitcoin was to ensure that nodes could be ran by
as many people as possible. Consider what happens when only a small cohort can define
what rules and transactions are valid and which are not. For this reason bitcoin must
limit how much data can be stored on the blockchain or else it becomes cost prohibitive
to replicate it (both in storage costs as well as network traffic).
