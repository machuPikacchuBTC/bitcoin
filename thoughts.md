# Interesting thoughts

## Energy
Bitcoin created a globally distributed network of computers drawing massive amounts of energy.
Every second humanity is trading [more and more useful energy](https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty#all)
for less and less bitcoin (remember no single country or group has a monopoly on this). That means there's a very clear
exchange rate between the global energy market and this currency and one that is difficult to manipulate for long.
I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to figure out what that implies for those who accumulate bitcoin.


## Precise measurements

The scientific and engineering community worldwide settled on the metric system and standardized on units like
Kilogram, Meter, etc. These units are fixed and we build things relative to that fixed unit. With money we've
been using the equivalent of an elastic band as a measuring tape. With bitcoin's fixed supply we can accurately
price goods across the world for the first time.

## Time

How can you prove that one event happened before another? All databases aside from bitcoin can be modified after the fact.
Timestamps can be corrupted or fabricated. "History is written by the winners" right? With bitcoin, you can't update the
past and using services like [OpenTimestamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenTimestamps) you can be confident in the
ordering of events.

Interestingly, even in our every day lives we have faulty memories and regardless of your confidence or trust that something
happened at a certain time in the past you can't actually _prove_ any facts even with video evidence
(especially now that AI is getting better). Due to bitcoin's nature you can trust that anything cryptographically tied to its
blockchain in fact happened and when (relative to other similar events).

## Economic Spam Filter

[Proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) (PoW) was originally invented to prevent "denial of service"
attacks and spam. Satoshi used this idea as a cornerstone of Bitcoin's architecture. What are the consequences of PoW
when added to money?

In order to mine bitcoin you have to prove you expended some amount of energy that the network decides is sufficient.
That energy must be in a useful form (how else could you use it to mine?) and is therefore valuable in any economy.
The miners are trading "value for value." As the value of each bitcoin grows the people who already have it will not part
with it unless it's for something of equal value.

Should you trade an appreciating currency for non-durable goods like disposable cups and unreliable, high maintenance cars?
You can, but then you'll have to do it again soon. And again. And again. Over time you'll lose more bitcoin than if you just
purchased quality goods in the first place. Those who understand this will be rewarded over time on average.

In order for producers to entice consumers to part with their bitcoin they'll need to demonstrate why their product or service
is actually valuable. We've created an incentive to produce quality goods again!

## Space Race?

Bitcoin uses a lot of energy. Whoever has more energy can earn more bitcoin even if they have inefficient mining
hardware. What is the most abundant source of energy? The Sun! The sun produces more energy than everything available
on the Earth and there's effectively no limit to how many solar panels you can deploy in space. Bitcoin could positively
motivate and accelerate the next space race.

## Cybersecurity

Bitcoin is by far the most secure computer network ever created. Military and intelligence agency networks around the world
have consistently been targeted and successfully infiltrated and yet despite it being completely in the open nobody has
figured out how to take down or corrupt bitcoin yet.

If you want to secure something important online then finding a way to leverage the data on the bitcoin blockchain is your best bet.

## AI

Scared of AI taking your job? Well, if you have a currency that appreciates over time then AI is working _for you_ rather than _against you_.
And if AI becomes completely autonomous then what money would it accept? Money created arbitrarily by random people or something neutral and native to the internet?
