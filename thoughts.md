# Interesting thoughts

## Energy
Bitcoin created a globally distributed network of computers drawing massive amounts of energy.
Every second humanity is trading [more and more useful energy](https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty#all)
for less and less bitcoin (remember no single country or group has a monopoly on this). That means there's a very clear
exchange rate between the global energy market and this currency and one that is difficult to manipulate for long.
I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to figure out what that implies for those who accumulate bitcoin.


## Precise measurements

The scientific and engineering community worldwide settled on the metric system and standardized on units like
Kilogram, Meter, etc. These units are fixed and we build things relative to that fixed unit. With money we've
been using the equivalent of an elastic band as a measuring tape. With bitcoin's fixed supply we can accurately
price goods across the world for the first time.

## Time

How can you prove that one event happened before another? All databases aside from bitcoin can be modified after the fact.
Timestamps can be corrupted or fabricated. "History is written by the winners" right? With bitcoin, you can't update the
past and using services like [OpenTimestamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenTimestamps) you can be confident in the
ordering of events.

Interestingly, even in our every day lives we have faulty memories and regardless of your confidence or trust that something
happened at a certain time in the past you can't actually _prove_ any facts even with video evidence
(especially now that AI is getting better). Due to bitcoin's nature you can trust that anything cryptographically tied to its
blockchain in fact happened and when (relative to other similar events).

## Space Race?

Bitcoin uses a lot of energy. Whoever has more energy can earn more bitcoin even if they have inefficient mining
hardware. What is the most abundant source of energy? The Sun! The sun produces more energy than everything available
on the Earth and there's effectively no limit to how many solar panels you can deploy in space. Bitcoin could positively
motivate and accelerate the next space race.

## Cybersecurity

Bitcoin is by far the most secure computer network ever created. Military and intelligence agency networks around the world
have consistently been targeted and successfully infiltrated and yet despite it being completely in the open nobody has
figured out how to take down or corrupt bitcoin yet.

If you want to secure something important online then finding a way to leverage the data on the bitcoin blockchain is your best bet.

## Spam filter

Hate spam? One of the principles of bitcoin, [proof of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) was invented to tackle spam.
Since there's finitely many bitcoin, if you require people to pay in bitcoin (which is programmable money) then you can rest assured
the spammers can't go on indefinitely. Even if they try, you'll get paid handsomely for it.

It's an economic spam filter as well. In order to acquire bitcoin you have to either mine it (which costs a lot of energy) or you have
to trade something else of value for it. There are no shortcuts. If you spend your bitcoin then you should be sure you're getting value
out of the purchase.

## AI

Scared of AI taking your job? Well, if you have a currency that appreciates over time then AI is working _for you_ rather than _against you_.
And if AI becomes completely autonomous then what money would it accept? Money created arbitrarily by random people or something neutral and native to the internet?
