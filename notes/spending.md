# Where to spend?

This note is not an endorsement of any product or service. It is meant to
demonstrate that bitcoin can be used for more than just "hodling."

I have no affiliation with any of the products or services listed here nor
any financial incentive to promote any of them. This is very much an evolving
landscape and many of these services are still in active development. They can
be experimental. Do your own research before using your bitcoin.

## Services

The following is a small sample of where you can use your bitcoin. 

### Banking

The following is a short list of ways you can do "traditional" banking and use a
Visa or Mastercard but the underlying funds are bitcoin instead of dollars. You can
enjoy all the same services you're used to, but with the purchasing power of bitcoin.
