# Podcasts

There are too many great bitcoin podcasts to keep up with them all, but here's
a very short list of some popular ones to get you started.

They can range from basic layman level and talking about cultural impact or the
history of bitcoin to very technical and discussing code. Some are good for beginners
while others would sound like a foreign language. Try each one out to see which ones
work for you!
