- "Money supply needs to be flexible or else you get the Great Depression" - You can write a whole book on why that statement is wrong. Firstly, evidence doesn't support that claim: look at civilizations that adopted gold and silver over the last millenia and didn't have crazy boom-bust cycles. Secondly, in order to rescue ourselves from each bust under the fiat system we have to "print" an accelerating amount of money. In 2008 we printed a record ~$780B in stimulus. As of 2024 we run an ANNUAL budget deficit of $1.8T and growing; housing and quality food has become unaffordable for most. In effect we've made the "bust" part of the cycle less acute, but it's become a steady and persistent systemic state. Thirdly, monetary stimulus is concentrated in the hands of a small group of people who benefit the most and over time it trickles out. I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to think of the many other things wrong here.

- "It's easy to hack. You'll lose all your money!" - the market cap as of November 2024 is $1.7 Trillion USD. The world's largest bug bounty is publicly available for anyone to act on it.

- "Too much wealth concentration." - It's true that a relatively small number of people have the majority of outstanding bitcoin. However, it's just as hard for them to acquire new bitcoin as it is for anyone else and as they spend it the distribution improves. Contrast that with the fiat system where inequality gets worse over time: home ownership and childcare has become unaffordable, etc.
- "Mining is too centralized." - Yes, mining has become more [centralized](https://www.tftc.io/bitcoin-mining-pool-centralization/) over time. It's something to be aware of and fight against. However, there are [several](https://ocean.xyz/docs/datum) ongoing [efforts](https://stratumprotocol.org/) to fix that. [This legend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULJjFwl6KlU) explains more. That video is outdated but the basic premise and long term idea still stands.
- [Quantum computing will break bitcoin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlzJyp3Qm7s)
- "It's too volatile to be useful." - Ironically bitcoin isn't volatile at all: everything else is. The bitcoin protocol strictly and publicly enforces coin issuance so there's a very predictable amount in circulation at all times. It's because you denominate the bitcoin value in USD/EUR/JPY/CAD/CNY/etc terms that it becomes so volatile. Those currencies have an extremely unpredictable nature to them (how much actually exists right now? are the people who create the most also in charge of reporting how much they created? how much will be minted tomorrow or in 5 years?) and all of our goods are priced in those terms.
- [What about a 51% attack?! - Andreas (2m)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncPyMUfNyVM)
- "XYZ blockchain is faster." - Bitcoin chose to limit the number of transactions in each block so that the total size of the database can easily fit on affordable hardware for as long as possible. If you allow more transactions then over time only wealthy people or corporations can afford to run the software. And blocks are added only once every 10 minutes on average so that there's enough time to reach global consensus. Any quicker and you would see mining activity centralize in one region.
- "Blockchain was the real innovation. Let's just use that." - A blockchain by itself is just a database. It can provide better auditability, but on its own it can't guarantee that transactions aren't removed over time. Bitcoin found a way to make it _physically_ near-impossible to remove old transactions.
- "Inflation is better than deflation!" - First: bitcoin ISN'T deflationary. The protocol issues new bitcoin every 10 minutes which is inflationary. Every 4 years the amount of newly introduced bitcoin gets cut in half until eventually (around 2140) it stops issuing new coins. Second: [Deflation is the natural state of a free market.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfnHjNYYuvs).
- "You can't build decentralized apps on it." - The Bitcoin community decided it's better to do a small number of things really well and focus on security. The more functionality built into the system, the more room for vulnerabilities and unpredictable behavior which is risky. With money you want to minimize risk. And aside from money there's no proven use case for blockchain-based decentralized apps. Just use AWS: it's cheaper and faster.
